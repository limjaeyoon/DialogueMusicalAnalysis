# Trasnlating Human Dialogue into Music

The goal of this project is finding the difference in the tone of different dialogues through the translating human dialogue into music. Music has different keys that the music is in. How about human dialogue translated into music? I would like to translate speech or dialogue of people into the language of music and observe the connection between the tone of the speech and the musical key of the speech. I'm interested in applying such idea to an automatic translator or a speech transcription through voice. I have been into music since I was very young. I grew up as a violinist and started producing music. Now, I play the guitar and the piano. I always loved listening to music. Through Wolfram Language audio processor, I got to learned about the music inside our daily speeches. I wanted to go deeper in the subject and observe is there are any musical quality within our spoken language.
